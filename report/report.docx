2. Dataset Introduction

Name of dataset: Erasmus mobility statistics 2014_2019

What it contains: Erasmus mobility statistics from 2014 to 2019
 around the world by europa.eu

Number of records & attributes: There are more than a million entries in the 
original dataset and over 1GB in size.

Due to computer performance issues when accessing a file that large,
A smaller subset of the first 5000 records was used for this report.

There are 24 attributes in this dataset,

3. Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/donjoeml/erasmus-mobility-statistics-2014-2019?select=sample.csv

4. Problem Statement / Questions

Example:

Where are the students coming from?

Where are the most popular destinations for Erasmus 
students?

what are the students studying?


5. Data Cleaning Steps

Commas appeared inside university names, causing parsing errors.
Removed some of those commas from the csv file, fixed parse error.
Due to difficulty removing all instances of misplaced commas in a 5000
records, all records with parse errors are skipped in processing.

Missing values
Ignored missing values

Duplicate removal
Did not remove duplicate values 

Column formatting using commas to align and separate values

6. Dashboard Explanation & Insights
